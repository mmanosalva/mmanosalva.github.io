I am a mathematics student at the UNAL campus in Bogot√°. My interests are number theory, cryptography, and algebra, particularly number theory in all its presentations. I also enjoy analysis, although not as a primary focus. Given the wide range of academic topics that interest me and in which I would like to work, I can contribute analysis to problems from many perspectives.

At the moment, I am focused on learning a lot of academic subjects of all kinds with the purpose of being very versatile and able to work in many areas. Here, I will upload publications on both mathematics and my personal programming projects, as well as solutions to the guide texts used in some of the courses at UNAL in the mathematics program. Many of my projects are also done with my friends and study partners, to whom I always express my gratitude for their collaboration and support.

I am a mathematics student in UNAL - Bogot√°. My interests are number theory, cryptography, and algebra, particularly number theory in all its presentations. I also enjoy analysis, although not as a primary focus. Given the wide range of academic topics that interest me and in which I would like to work, I can contribute analysis to problems from many perspectives.

At the moment, I am focused on learning a lot of academic subjects of all kinds with the purpose of being very versatile and able to work in many areas. Here, I will upload publications on both mathematics and my personal programming projects, as well as solutions to the guide texts used in some of the courses at UNAL in the mathematics program. Many of my projects are also done with my friends and study partners, to whom I always express my gratitude for their collaboration and support.

$$L(s, \chi)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}$$

I deeply love mathematics, on this long journey they have become a fundamental part of my life. If you're reading this and have doubts about whether the effort required to study this wonderful science is worth, let me tell you that it is. The beauty of mathematics is poetic, we all have a mathematician inside us with different styles and abilities. The richness of mathematics is a consequence of how diverse we mathematicians are, we all contribute our grain of sand to make this beautiful art take shape. We have all had different difficulties in our education, but sometimes it is necessary to go through darkness to appreciate the small flashes of light, that is the essence of mathematical beauty.

Those who embark on the Mathematics career must be aware of their entry into an inexhaustible world, a lifelong learning that will never cease, but that will drive them to explore increasingly surprising territories of knowledge. The stages on this path are long and difficult, often ungrateful and disappointing, but also, at certain privileged moments, fascinating and totally revealing. Once one perceives the extraordinary complexity of the mathematical world, the naive person will hardly be able to leave it again.

*The naive person will never be the same again.*
